# DSA-Practice-Sheet

## Project Overview

This project is a React-based coding platform focused on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It provides users with a collection of famous DSA problems, including arrays, stacks, queues, graphs, and more. For each problem, users can explore both brute-force and optimal solutions, with links to external websites for further practice. Users can mark problems as "solved" once they complete them. The back-end is powered by Firebase, ensuring seamless data management and user authentication.

## Features

- **Data Structures & Algorithms Problems**: A comprehensive collection of DSA problems such as arrays, stacks, queues, and graphs.
- **Solutions**: Each problem is accompanied by brute-force and optimal solutions to help users understand different approaches.
- **External Links**: Provides links to external coding platforms (such as LeetCode or HackerRank) where users can practice solving the problem.
- **Problem Solved Tracking**: Users can mark problems as solved once they finish practicing.
- **Firebase Integration**: Complete backend functionality powered by Firebase for user management, data storage, and real-time updates.
  
## Technologies Used

- **React**: Front-end framework for building the user interface.
- **Firebase**: Back-end service used for authentication, database management, and real-time data storage.
- **HTML5/CSS3**: For structuring and styling the UI.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for interactive components and user functionality.
